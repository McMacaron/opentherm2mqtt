OpenThermGateway2MQTT

## What

Control (parts of) the world of OpenTherm using mqtt.

## How

Connect a USB Serial cable to your Raspberry Pi, install Node.js and run this code to allow mqtt publishing of OpenTherm realtime data. It's pub/sub so you can control the OpenTherm Gateway (otg) using mqtt messages.

## Why

I want to create Skynet at home.
